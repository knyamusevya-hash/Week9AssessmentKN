1. Open SQL Server Management Studio 
2. Connect to Northwind DB (Same DB as you used in Geek Week)

3. Write a query that shows each employee’s first name and the 
number of orders they have placed. Group the results by employee’s first name.

Please copy & paste your SQL query below AND add an explanation of the query: 

SELECT e.FirstName;
    COUNT [o.OrderID] AS NumberOfOrders
FROM Employees e
JOIN Orders o ON e.EmployeeID = o.EmployeeID
GROUP BY e.FirstName; 

This connects the Employees table with the Orders table by EmployeeID
